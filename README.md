# wander-nuxt

This project is one that is near and dear to my heart. My girlfriend and I are working on building out a van currently and wanted to chronicle things for ourselves and (maybe) others. We'll see how things shake out. 

Since I am still pretty new to frontend web development, and I love the challenge, I jumped straight into building the page. I figure that the content will grow as I learn more and more. My layouts and content will evolve with me. 

Probably the hardest part of this project was figuring out how I wanted to design it. Before this project I had only ever made anything using HTML, CSS (including scss) and vanilla JS. Even though it is the first project that I have made using Vue, the coding was easier than the layout and content for each page. 

I may have to start wireframing things from here on out. But, like I said, this is all about learning more and evolving.

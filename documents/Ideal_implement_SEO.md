 - Include another section with how you would ideally implement SEO on your site

Since my website will be about our van build, I will be chronicling our work as we go along. This will create the need for more header tags, specifically <h2> and <h3>. Long-form content will also give me more opportunity to use keywords in a way that won’t feel forced, will provide more potential featured snippets and help to create more organic traffic. Adding dates to articles could also help to get my CTR higher. The more fresh content, the better. A quality, high contrast ratio favicon could also help to get more mobile attention as well as develop a brand that people can easily recognize. Focusing on a “mobile first” approach to build my website will also be key. Considering how much information there is about doing a van build right now, I intend to learn about what other sites are doing. Finding pages that reference multiple other pages with the same topic as my own and then seeing where I can take a different approach. 

I have added canonical information into the links of each page’s head script to hopefully make it easier for any search crawlers. I would also use some sort of analytics to help generate more traffic and figure out where my shortfalls are.
